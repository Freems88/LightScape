# LightScape

LightScape is an open-source project aimed at creating solar exposure mapping using computer vision and augmented reality (AR) on smartphones. By leveraging your smartphone's camera, GPS, and AR capabilities, LightScape aims to provide accurate and real-time solar exposure heat maps for any location.

## Features

- Real-time solar exposure mapping
- 3D environment mapping using computer vision
- AR visualization of solar exposure data
- Support for both Android and iOS devices

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the LightScape project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

To contribute to or use LightScape, you'll need the following tools and libraries:

- Python 3.6 or later: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- OpenCV: A powerful computer vision library for image processing tasks. Install it using pip: `pip install opencv-python`
- NumPy: A library for numerical operations in Python. Install it using pip: `pip install numpy`
- pyephem (Optional): A library for astronomical computations, including sun position calculation. Install it using pip: `pip install pyephem`

These prerequisites are necessary for working on the core functionality of LightScape. Additional tools and libraries may be needed for mobile app development (e.g., React Native or Flutter) and web app development (e.g., React, Angular, or Vue.js).

### Installation

1. Clone the LightScape repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LightScape.git
2. Open the project in Android Studio or Xcode, depending on your target platform.
3. Follow the instructions to install and configure the required libraries (OpenCV, TensorFlow, ARCore/ARKit).
4. Build and run the project on your device or emulator.
