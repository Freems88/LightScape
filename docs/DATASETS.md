# Datasets for LightScape

This document lists some publicly available datasets that can be used for training and testing purposes in the LightScape project. These datasets primarily focus on outdoor environments, as the main goal of LightScape is to map and analyze sun exposure in outdoor settings.

## 1. Sun3D
Sun3D is a dataset of RGB-D sequences with camera pose information recorded in various indoor and outdoor environments. The outdoor sequences can be useful for LightScape's environment mapping tasks.

## 2. ScanNet
ScanNet is an RGB-D dataset containing both indoor and outdoor 3D reconstructions. The outdoor scenes in this dataset can be helpful for developing and testing LightScape's 3D environment mapping functionality.

## 3. RobotCar
The RobotCar dataset contains over 100 repetitions of a consistent route through Oxford, UK, captured by an autonomous car. This dataset provides time-stamped, geo-referenced RGB and LiDAR data that can be useful for LightScape's outdoor mapping and sun exposure calculations.

## 4. DublinCity
DublinCity is a dataset that provides aerial LiDAR data, high-resolution aerial imagery, and ground-based imagery for a large part of Dublin City, Ireland. This dataset can be helpful for experimenting with LightScape's environment mapping and sun exposure analysis in an urban context.
