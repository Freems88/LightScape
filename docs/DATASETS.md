## Datasets for LightScape

The following datasets can be used for testing and developing LightScape's environment mapping and solar exposure calculations:

1. **[SUNCG](https://sscnet.cs.princeton.edu/)**: A large-scale dataset of synthetic indoor scenes with 3D models and semantic annotations. Suitable for tasks like scene understanding and 3D object detection.

2. **[NYU Depth Dataset V2](https://cs.nyu.edu/~silberman/datasets/nyu_depth_v2.html)**: A dataset containing RGB and depth images of indoor scenes. Useful for tasks like depth estimation and semantic segmentation.

3. **[Matterport3D](https://niessner.github.io/Matterport/)**: A dataset containing RGB-D images and 3D reconstructions of indoor scenes. Covers a wide range of building types and can be used for tasks like 3D object detection and semantic segmentation.

4. **[KITTI](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/)**: A dataset for autonomous driving, containing images, LIDAR data, and GPS/IMU information. Suitable for tasks like 3D object detection and semantic segmentation in outdoor environments.

5. **[Semantic3D](http://www.semantic3d.net/)**: A large-scale dataset of outdoor scenes containing 3D point clouds with semantic annotations. Useful for tasks like semantic segmentation and scene understanding in outdoor environments.

Please note that these datasets have their own licensing terms and requirements. Make sure to respect the original datasets' licensing terms when using them for your project.
