How LightScape Works
LightScape is an open-source project that aims to provide a user-friendly application for mapping solar exposure using a smartphone's camera, GPS, and sensors. This document outlines the core functionality of LightScape and explains how its key features work together.

Data Capture
LightScape utilizes the smartphone's camera to capture images of the environment and gathers data from the GPS and sensors to determine the user's location and orientation. This information is used to estimate solar exposure in the captured environment.

3D Environment Mapping
Computer vision techniques are employed to create a 3D map of the environment based on the captured images. This map provides a spatial context for the solar exposure data, allowing LightScape to accurately estimate the sun's position and the impact of shading from objects in the environment.

Solar Exposure Estimation
With the 3D environment map and the user's location and orientation data, LightScape calculates the solar exposure for each point in the map. This process considers factors such as the sun's position, the time of day, and the shading from surrounding objects to provide a reliable estimate of the solar exposure in the captured environment.

Augmented Reality Visualization
LightScape uses Augmented Reality (AR) to visualize the solar exposure data in the user's view. The app overlays a heatmap on the 3D environment map, providing an intuitive representation of the solar exposure levels in the captured area. Users can interact with the heatmap and gain insights into the solar exposure distribution within the environment.

Freemium and Premium Features
LightScape offers both free and premium versions to cater to a wide range of users. The free version provides basic functionality with local processing, while the premium version offers advanced features and leverages cloud-based processing for improved performance and accuracy. By offering different levels of functionality, LightScape aims to accommodate various user needs and preferences.

By combining these features, LightScape provides a comprehensive and user-friendly solution for mapping solar exposure, making it a valuable tool for homeowners, architects, and solar industry professionals alike.
